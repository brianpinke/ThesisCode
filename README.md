# Vesicularity and Hydrothermal Alteration in Volcanic-Derived Mass Wasting Deposits and the Implications for Downstream Sediment Pulse Attenuation

## Scripts by Brian Pinke for M.S. Thesis in Geology at Western Washington University 2024

This repository is for a Brian Pinke's M.S. Thesis research project with Dr. Allison Pfeiffer at Western Washington University, focused on understanding the rock clast size, strength, and abrasion potential in 5 different volcanic mass wasting deposits in the Pacific Northwest.
